# LaTeX-IUBH-Template

This is a rudimentary LaTeX set-up to help students at IUBH-Online to realize assignments, workboos, bachelor-thesis or masters' thesis. It includes a few common LaTeX formats and macros which must be adapted to the precise needs.

Tested with `pdflatex` (using the TeXlive distribution).

Maintained by @polx based on works of JÃ¶rg Sawatzki and Ralf Kneuper.
