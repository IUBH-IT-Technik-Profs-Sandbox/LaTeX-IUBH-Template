 A good editor is essential. Sometimes combined editors and compilers (e.g. TeXShop) can be really productive. Make sure you learn the use of synchronized navigation then.

A vector graphic is one where strokes remain strokes even at the highest resolutions: e.g. the Figure~\ref{fig:spiral} or the Logo on the \hyperref[titlePage]{Titelblatt} (notice: you can click from here to there).
Many tools generate vector-graphics for plots from any data-set. E.g. Plotly (with the use of the Browser-Print), MatPlotLib or even OpenOffice, LibreOffice or MS-Excel.

\section{Literature References}

\section{Formulæ}

A formula can be written inline, e.g. as $ \frac{d}{dx}\mbox{arctg}(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}$ or, in centered math:

\begin{equation}  \frac{d}{dx}\mbox{arctg}(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2} \label{arctanderivative}\end{equation}

Notice that formulæ that are centered start bigger (technically, they start in \verb+\displaystyle+) than they start inline (technically, they start in \verb+\textstyle+ all subsequents reductions, e.g. an exponent, goes to \verb+\scriptstyle+ then \verb+\scriptscriptstyle+). Indeed a best effort is made so that inline formulæ do not change the line height which would bother the eye of a reader.

Formulæ can be given a number and a label. Numbering happens automatically with \verb+\begin{equation}+ and \verb+\end{equation}+ and can be avoided if enclosing the formula betwee \verb+\[+ and \verb+\]+. If using the \verb+\label+ macro inside, you can refer automatically to this equation using \verb+\ref{label}+. E.g. Thanks to equation~\ref{arctanderivative} one dare say that:

\begin{equation} \int_0^t \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx = \mbox{arctan}(t) \end{equation}
